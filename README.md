# Huisman_Weissing1999
Reproducing some of the results of a paper on the so called "paradox of the plankton" by Huisman and Weissing (1999), using the deSolve package by Soetaert, Petzoldt and Setzer (2010).

The “paradox of the plankton” describes a phenomenon, that a lot of phytoplankton species may persist on only a few of resources and create stable systems, without one plankton species going extinct. This contradicts competition theory which says that the number of coexisting species cannot exceed the number of limiting resources (Huisman and Weissing, 1999). Huisman and Weissing (1999) show using an established competition model that 6 or 9 phytoplankton species may persist on only 3 limiting resources.
